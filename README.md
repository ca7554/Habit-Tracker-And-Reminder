## Intro
This repository is a personal project, created for fun and to practice Android Development and Kotlin. The app allows users to create and manage their habits, providing timely notifications on their devices for effective habit tracking. 

## Description
The goal of this project was to develop an app that allows users to track and reinforce their habits through timely reminders. The app leverages various technologies to enhance the user experience. It utilizes Room, a powerful persistence library that seamlessly interacts with SQLite, enabling smooth database access and management for the habits and their related data. Additionally, the app incorporates a dynamic recycler view, which displays a comprehensive list of added habits and automatically updates in response to any changes made in the database.

The user interface is created using a combination of XML and Jetpack Compose. Whenever a new habit is added, the app generates notifications at specified intervals, be it daily or weekly, even when the app is not actively in use. Users can easily cancel these notifications by deleting the corresponding habit within the app, offering them full control over their reminders.

Looking ahead, my plan is to continuously enhance and expand this app, incorporating additional features that will allow me to further refine my Android development skills and increase my proficiency with Kotlin.
